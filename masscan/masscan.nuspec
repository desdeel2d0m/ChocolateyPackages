### MASSCAN: Mass IP port scanner
This is an Internet-scale port scanner. It can scan the entire Internet in under 5 minutes, transmitting 10 million packets per second, from a single machine.

Its usage (parameters, output) is similar to nmap, the most famous port scanner. When in doubt, try one of those features -- features that support widespread scanning of many machines are supported, while in-depth scanning of single machines aren't.

Internally, it uses asynchronous transmission, similar to port scanners like scanrand, unicornscan, and ZMap. It's more flexible, allowing arbitrary port and address ranges.

NOTE: masscan uses its own ad hoc TCP/IP stack. Anything other than simple port scans may cause conflict with the local TCP/IP stack. This means you need to use either the --src-ip option to run from a different IP address, or use --src-port to configure which source ports masscan uses, then also configure the internal firewall (like pf or iptables) to firewall those ports from the rest of the operating system.
